          Tailgating
        </h2>
        <p>
          The University of Kentucky has one of the more underrated tailgating scenes in the SEC, probably because it’s known more for its basketball program than for football. In actuality, football tailgating is just as ardent at UK as anywhere else.<br>
          <br>Many of the parking lots closest to Kroger Field are open to game-day permit buyers, although a few sections are reserved for VIPs and season-ticket holders. All of them allow tailgating, and lots open at 8 a.m. on game days. Plan to arrive early.<br>

          <br>There are a few regulations to keep in mind at University of Kentucky tailgating, including:<br>

          <br>- Tent setup is allowed starting at noon on Fridays.<br>
          - Tents must be removed by noon on Sunday after game.<br>
          - Portable generators must be approved by UK Athletics.<br>
          - Open flames are not permitted unless the fire marshal approves.<br>
          - No tents larger than 10’ x 10’ are allowed on the green spaces.<br>
