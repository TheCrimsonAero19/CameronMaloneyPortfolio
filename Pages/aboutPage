            Gallettes is a Gameday favorite and a Tuscaloosa tradition since 1976. Home of the famous Yellow Hammer drink, the local bar is filled with natural light, open spaces video walls, large TVs, and more.<br>
            <br>After a couple of Yellowhammers, or anything the bar tosses up, you’ll be bouncing along to the music that’s never too quiet. More than likely you will be taken by surprise when the song sung in that classic dive bar unison isn’t a Journey song, or even Sweet Home Alabama, but “ Dixieland Delight”.<br>
            <br>As the closest bar to Bryant-Denny Stadium, it’s a gameday tradition everyone enjoys – whether it’s on a gameday or just a fun night out.

            The Houndstooth Sports Bar and Restaurant opened its doors in July of 1988 at 1300 University Blvd. in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Since that time, we have been named the #1 College Sports Bar and the #14 Sports Bar in the Nation by Sports Illustrated and SI On Campus. We strive to offer a comfortable and friendly atmosphere with a wide array of drinks and the coldest beer in town. We now have a 130" projection screen and over 40 HD flat screen TVs located throughout the bar and even in the bathrooms so you won’t miss any action of your favorite game. We also offer outdoor seating on our huge patio with 2 covered areas, more TVs, and a spectacular view of Bryant-Denny Stadium, located just a few blocks away. If that’s not enough, we have pool tables, darts, and Golden Tee 2021. Come on out and see what everybody has been talking about and become a part our family.

            Information
          </h2>
          <p>
            From a small campus of seven buildings in the wilderness on the main road between Tuscaloosa and Huntsville (now University Boulevard) in the 1830s, UA has grown to a massive 1,970-acre campus in the heart of Tuscaloosa. There are 297 buildings on campus containing some 10,600,000 square feet of space. In 2010, the school added 168 acres to its campus by purchasing the land formerly belonging to Bryce Hospital. It also plans to acquire more land to accommodate the continuing growth of the enrollment.<br>
            <br>The Alabama Crimson Tide football program represents the University of Alabama. The team's head coach is Nick Saban, who has led the Tide to six national championships over his tenure.[6] The Crimson Tide is among the most storied and decorated football programs in NCAA history. Since beginning play in 1892, the program claims 18 national championships.Alabama has 942 official victories[a][b] in NCAA Division I (an additional 21 victories were vacated, and eight victories and one tie were forfeited). Alabama has won 33 conference championships (4 Southern Conference and 29 SEC championships), and has made an NCAA-record 75 postseason bowl appearances.<br>
            <br>The men's basketball program has spent most of its history in the shadow of Alabama's football team, but has risen in stature over the past several decades. Under former coach Mark Gottfried, the team achieved a No. 1 national ranking briefly in 2003, and competed for an NCAA Regional Tournament Championship in 2004.

          Tailgating
        </h2>
        <p>
          The University of Alabama’s Crimson Tide is more than another college team. The reigning national champs are likely the signature football team of the entire NCAA. The history and legacy of Alabama football have shaped the course of the game for decades, and their fans are justifiably proud of it.<br>

          <br>Tailgating at the University of Alabama is an all-encompassing experience that takes over all of Tuscaloosa when the Tide plays. You won’t have any trouble finding a great spot to park and party. Tailgating at the University of Alabama takes place in virtually all the parking lots around the stadium. The University is behind tailgating so much that they’ve set up reserved tailgating. They even offer tips on non-reserved tailgating.<br>
          <br>The Quad is a must-see on game day, and it’s a place rich with history. It’s the site where the Tide played their first few seasons. Now, it serves as the primary on-campus tailgating stop, featuring tents and vendors galore. The party starts a few hours before game time and doesn’t stop until about 90 minutes after the game’s finished.<br>
          <br>The Walk of Champions happens at the north end of Bryant-Denny Stadium about 2 hours and 15 minutes before game time. It’s when the players walk from their buses, through a sea of cheering Tide fans and rows of plaques and statues, and into the stadium. It’s a spine-chilling moment, so get there early.

          Restraunts
        </h2>
        <p>
          Buffalo Phil's:<br>
          1149 University Blvd, Tuscaloosa, AL 35401 • (205) 758-3318.
          Buffalo Phil's is a restaurant well-tested in "the art of wings". Exclusive recipes, secret ingredients, and food preparation techniques designed to make Buffalo Phil's food consistently fresh help make Buffalo Phil's food consistently delicious.<br>

          <br>Taco Mama:<br>
          2104A University Blvd, Tuscaloosa, AL 35401 • (205) 409-8173.
          Because everyone knows college kids love tasty tacos, the Tuscaloosa location was a no-brainer. Located on University between The Strip and bustling downtown Tuscaloosa, Taco Mama in T-Town was built out of a warehouse that had neither air conditioning or plumbing when we found it (don’t worry; we had both put in). But the exposed brick interior and garage door opening to the street were a perfect starting point and with the addition of an ample patio, it only got better.<br>

          <br>Dreamland Bar-b-Que:<br>
          5535 15th Ave. East, Tuscaloosa, Al. 35405 • (205) 758-8135.
          Our flagship restaurant opened in 1958, and Dreamland founder John “Big Daddy” Bishop built it himself. Our humble, local bar-b-cue joint quickly became a favorite gathering spot for members of the Alabama football coaching staff to bring recruits. It wasn’t long before we became THE gameday destination in Tuscaloosa.
