            Gallettes is a Gameday favorite and a Tuscaloosa tradition since 1976. Home of the famous Yellow Hammer drink, the local bar is filled with natural light, open spaces video walls, large TVs, and more.<br>
            <br>After a couple of Yellowhammers, or anything the bar tosses up, you’ll be bouncing along to the music that’s never too quiet. More than likely you will be taken by surprise when the song sung in that classic dive bar unison isn’t a Journey song, or even Sweet Home Alabama, but “ Dixieland Delight”.<br>
            <br>As the closest bar to Bryant-Denny Stadium, it’s a gameday tradition everyone enjoys – whether it’s on a gameday or just a fun night out.

            Information
          </h2>
          <p>
            From a small campus of seven buildings in the wilderness on the main road between Tuscaloosa and Huntsville (now University Boulevard) in the 1830s, UA has grown to a massive 1,970-acre campus in the heart of Tuscaloosa. There are 297 buildings on campus containing some 10,600,000 square feet of space. In 2010, the school added 168 acres to its campus by purchasing the land formerly belonging to Bryce Hospital. It also plans to acquire more land to accommodate the continuing growth of the enrollment.<br>
            <br>The Alabama Crimson Tide football program represents the University of Alabama. The team's head coach is Nick Saban, who has led the Tide to six national championships over his tenure.[6] The Crimson Tide is among the most storied and decorated football programs in NCAA history. Since beginning play in 1892, the program claims 18 national championships.Alabama has 942 official victories[a][b] in NCAA Division I (an additional 21 victories were vacated, and eight victories and one tie were forfeited). Alabama has won 33 conference championships (4 Southern Conference and 29 SEC championships), and has made an NCAA-record 75 postseason bowl appearances.<br>
            <br>The men's basketball program has spent most of its history in the shadow of Alabama's football team, but has risen in stature over the past several decades. Under former coach Mark Gottfried, the team achieved a No. 1 national ranking briefly in 2003, and competed for an NCAA Regional Tournament Championship in 2004.

          Tailgating
        </h2>
        <p>
          The University of Alabama’s Crimson Tide is more than another college team. The reigning national champs are likely the signature football team of the entire NCAA. The history and legacy of Alabama football have shaped the course of the game for decades, and their fans are justifiably proud of it.<br>

          <br>Tailgating at the University of Alabama is an all-encompassing experience that takes over all of Tuscaloosa when the Tide plays. You won’t have any trouble finding a great spot to park and party.<br>
          <br>The Quad is a must-see on game day, and it’s a place rich with history. It’s the site where the Tide played their first few seasons. Now, it serves as the primary on-campus tailgating stop, featuring tents and vendors galore. The party starts a few hours before game time and doesn’t stop until about 90 minutes after the game’s finished.
